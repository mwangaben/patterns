# Design Patterns in PHP [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mwangaben/patterns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mwangaben/patterns)
#### 1.Observer
   > This design patterns fits when the changes of one object need the some effects to take place elsewhere. Through this design pattern the objective can be archieved in a decoupled way whereby when the changes happen on one object other object which are interested on that change are notified upon changes and act upon that changes on their own way.
    
  >> Let say when a parcel is received in the postoffice the post  officer and client whose parcel has aarived needs to be notified and both of them need to respond
     to differently to the notification. 
     
  >> Post officer prepares necessary documents for parcel collection from their office
      While the client will go to the post office to collect his parcel 
#### 2.The Chain Of Responsibilities 

   > This design pattern enable to associate numbers of tasks to be handled when appropriate by any Object in the chain.   
    
  >> For example a Telecommunication company that has an automated customer care services for common issues faced by their customers. When a customer make a call to the system asks a question and pass him/her down to the next
    chain when the current one is not able to fix the issue. 
    
  >> Finally when the system failed to fix the issue with the customer, the call is redirected to a customer care who happens to be a human being as a last resort.
